# 03 — API, node protocol, and domain events

## 1. API design rules

- JSON over HTTPS for control-plane APIs.
- Versioned paths under `/v1`.
- UTC timestamps in RFC 3339 form.
- ULID-based canonical object identifiers.
- RFC 7807-style problem responses with stable MRR error codes.
- `Idempotency-Key` required for create and action endpoints.
- ETags or object revision preconditions required for mutable workflow actions.
- Pagination by opaque cursor.
- All payloads validated against published JSON Schemas.
- Authentication and authorization are mandatory except explicitly public node manifests.

A successful HTTP response does not imply epistemic verification. Domain status is always explicit in the returned object.

## 2. Error envelope

```json
{
  "type": "urn:mrr:problem:policy-denied",
  "title": "Policy denied the requested action",
  "status": 403,
  "code": "MRR_POLICY_DENIED",
  "detail": "Participant-identifiable data cannot leave this node.",
  "trace_id": "01J...",
  "object_id": "urn:mrr:task:01J...",
  "policy_decision_id": "urn:mrr:policy-decision:01J...",
  "retryable": false
}
```

Stable error codes include:

```text

MRR_STATE_TRANSITION_INVALID
MRR_SCORE_NOT_ACTIVE
MRR_POLICY_DENIED
MRR_APPROVAL_REQUIRED
MRR_SIGNATURE_INVALID

MRR_SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE
MRR_ANCHOR_UNRESOLVED
MRR_SELF_VERIFICATION_FORBIDDEN
MRR_BUDGET_EXCEEDED
MRR_CONFLICT
MRR_DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE
```

## 3. Control-plane REST surface

### 3.1 Research Scores

POST   /v1/research-scores/{id}/revise
POST   /v1/research-scores/{id}/suspend
GET    /v1/research-scores/{id}/history
```

### 3.2 Research Runs and branches

```text
POST   /v1/research-runs
GET    /v1/research-runs/{id}
POST   /v1/research-runs/{id}/plan
POST   /v1/research-runs/{id}/pause

GET    /v1/nodes
GET    /v1/nodes/{id}
POST   /v1/nodes/manifests
GET    /v1/capabilities
POST   /v1/capability-matches
```

A capability match is advisory. It does not create permission or acceptance.

### 3.4 Tasks and runs

```text
POST   /v1/tasks
GET    /v1/tasks/{id}
POST   /v1/tasks/{id}/offer
POST   /v1/tasks/{id}/accept-origin-modification

GET    /v1/tasks/{id}/attempts
GET    /v1/runs/{id}
GET    /v1/runs/{id}/manifest
```

### 3.5 Artifacts and Evidence Crates

```text
POST   /v1/artifacts/initiate-upload
POST   /v1/artifacts/{id}/complete-upload
GET    /v1/artifacts/{id}/metadata
GET    /v1/artifacts/{id}/download
POST   /v1/evidence-crates
GET    /v1/evidence-crates/{id}
POST   /v1/evidence-crates/{id}/seal
POST   /v1/evidence-crates/{id}/export
```

Downloads are subject to object classification, local policy, transfer contracts, and short-lived authorization.

### 3.6 Claims and evidence

```

### 3.7 Reviews and verification

```text
POST   /v1/reviews
GET    /v1/reviews/{id}
POST   /v1/verifications
GET    /v1/verifications/{id}
POST   /v1/verifications/{id}/checks
POST   /v1/verifications/{id}/complete
POST   /v1/adjudications
```

### 3.8 Transfers and obligations

```text

GET    /v1/corrections/{id}/impact
POST   /v1/corrections/{id}/notify
POST   /v1/corrections/{id}/respond
POST   /v1/corrections/{id}/resolve
```

### 3.10 Projections

```text
POST   /v1/projections
GET    /v1/projections/{id}
POST   /v1/projections/{id}/render
POST   /v1/projections/{id}/request-publication-approval
POST   /v1/projections/{id}/publish
```

## 4. Node protocol

Every online node exposes a minimal mutually authenticated API.

```text
GET    /.well-known/mrr-node
GET    /v1/manifest
POST   /v1/tasks/inbox
GET    /v1/tasks/{id}
POST   /v1/tasks/{id}/decision
POST   /v1/tasks/{id}/start
POST   /v1/tasks/{id}/cancel
GET    /v1/tasks/{id}/status
GET    /v1/tasks/{id}/result
POST   /v1/corrections/inbox
POST   /v1/transfers/inbox
GET    /v1/health
```

### 4.1 Task decision

A node decision is one of:

```json
{
  "decision": "accept | modify | defer | reject | require_human_approval",
  "task_id": "urn:mrr:task:...",
  "task_revision": 1,
  "policy_decision_id": "urn:mrr:policy-decision:...",
  "modified_task": null,
  "reason_codes": ["DATA_RESIDENCY"],
  "message": "Only aggregate output is permitted.",
  "signed_at": "2026-07-17T12:00:00Z",
  "signature": {}
}
```

### 4.2 Store-and-forward envelopes

Offline exchange uses a transport envelope containing:

- envelope identifier and nonce;
- sender and intended recipient;
- object type and schema version;
- payload hash;
- creation and expiry;
- encryption metadata;
- sender signature;
- optional acknowledgement request.

A recipient MUST reject expired, replayed, misaddressed, untrusted, or hash-invalid envelopes before deserializing untrusted nested content beyond what is required for verification.

## 5. Domain event architecture

MRR uses append-only domain events for audit and reliable integration. Current state is materialized in PostgreSQL tables. Full event sourcing of every aggregate is not required for v1.

### 5.1 Event envelope

```json
{
  "event_id": "urn:mrr:event:01J...",
  "event_type": "claim.status_changed",
  "event_version": 1,
  "occurred_at": "2026-07-17T12:00:00Z",
  "recorded_at": "2026-07-17T12:00:01Z",
  "practice_id": "urn:mrr:practice:01J...",
  "actor": {
    "type": "person | service | agent | node",
    "id": "urn:mrr:agent:01J...",
    "role": "verifier"
  },
  "correlation_id": "urn:mrr:research-run:01J...",
  "causation_id": "urn:mrr:event:01J...",
  "object_id": "urn:mrr:claim:01J...",
  "object_revision": 3,
  "policy_version": "policy-2026-07-01",
  "payload_hash": "sha256:...",
  "payload": {}
}
```

### 5.2 Required events

```

Refresh note (2026-07-21): the list above was consolidated after epics E6 and
K0–K1 landed. `transfer.created`, `obligation.propagated`, `obligation.deferred`,
`method_profile.*`, `claim.ruling_attached`, and `claim.kill_condition_triggered`
record implemented behavior (the "floor, not ceiling" readings adopted during
those epics, now canonical). `correction.notification_received` is DECLARED but
not yet implemented: today a receiving practice that computes an empty local
impact set leaves no durable trace of the receipt — implementing this event (so
an auditor can reconstruct "received and no-op'd" from the log alone) is assigned
to the E9 pre-hardening batch, together with a `maxItems` bound for
`CorrectionNotification.notified_object_ids` (currently unbounded; receipt cost
scales with list size) and a specification decision on re-notification semantics
when later impact discovery grows the notified set for an already-notified
recipient (delivery idempotency is currently keyed on the recipient alone).

Re-notification semantics (2026-07-21, E9-T00 item 3, DECIDED): per-recipient
notification idempotency in `notify_affected_practices` is, and remains, keyed
on `recipient_practice_id` ALONE for a given `correction_id` — once a recipient
is recorded `"sent"` (a `correction.notification_sent` event with
`delivery_status == "sent"`), no later call re-notifies that recipient for
that correction, regardless of whether the correction's own known
`impact_objects` set has since grown to include object ids that recipient's
earlier `notified_object_ids` never covered. This is a settled specification
position, not an open implementation detail. Re-notifying an already-`sent`
recipient when impact discovery later grows the notified set is left as an
explicitly named FUTURE task: whether it is caller-driven (the caller
re-invokes with an explicit "force" flag), automatic (`propagate_impact`
itself detects growth and re-arms the per-recipient "sent" tracking), or
something else is left genuinely open, not pre-judged — no speculative hook
for it exists in the current implementation.

### 5.3 Transactional outbox

State changes and event publication MUST use a transactional outbox so that committed domain changes cannot silently lose their corresponding event. Consumers MUST be idempotent.

## 6. Concurrency and revisions

- Mutating commands include `expected_revision` or `If-Match`.
- Revision conflicts return `409 MRR_CONFLICT` with current revision metadata.
- Sealed objects reject mutation with `409 MRR_STATE_TRANSITION_INVALID`.
- Long workflows use correlation and causation IDs, not distributed database transactions.
- Compensating actions create new events; they never erase previous events.

## 7. Authentication and authorization

### 7.1 Human and service identities

- OIDC access tokens for control-plane users and services.
- Scoped roles and practice membership.
- Short token lifetime.
- Step-up authentication for A4 actions and key-management operations.

### 7.2 Node identities

- mTLS for transport;
- signed application payloads for end-to-end object integrity;
- trust store managed per practice;
- key rotation without changing practice identity;
- revocation checked before accepting new work.

### 7.3 Authorization dimensions

Authorization MUST evaluate:

- actor and role;
- practice ownership;
- object classification;
- requested action and autonomy level;
- Research Score permissions;
- local node policy;
- transfer contract;
- consent and ethics constraints;
- approval presence and validity;
- budget and expiry.

## 8. Query and search

Search is a convenience layer, never the authoritative object store.

- Full-text and vector search MAY index permitted object projections.
- Search results MUST resolve to canonical object IDs and revisions.
- Index staleness MUST be visible.
- Restricted content MUST not be embedded or indexed outside permitted boundaries.
- Retrieval results are untrusted content and cannot modify tool policy.

## 9. API compatibility

- Additive optional fields MAY be introduced within a major version.
- Removing or changing semantics requires a new schema or API version.
- Consumers MUST ignore unknown optional fields but MUST reject unknown enum values when they affect safety or state transitions.
- Every schema change requires compatibility fixtures and migration notes.
